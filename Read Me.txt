	S.C.Out

I) How to compile ?
--------------------
To compile S.C.Out, you must have SDL and SDL_ttf installed (development libraries).
If you are on Linux, you will also need FreeType.
All these libraries are freely downloadable from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php, http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ and http://www.freetype.org/
On Linux, when these libraries are installed, just type "make" in the SCOUT_src folder, the result will be in the build folder.

II) Bugs report
